# goOpenCVTemplate 
A starter repository for training a cascade classifier on game objects using [gocv](https://gocv.io/) on X11.

Follow the [OpenCV Cascade Classifier training article](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html) when using this repository, most things are automated here.

Note:
 * Training parameters should be adjusted to match the desired output
 * Adjust OpenCV application paths to match your system's OpenCV installation
 * `uninput`, `xdotool`, and `X11` are the current requirements, so no Windows, Mac, or Wayland
